<<github_vulnerability>> module contains experiment files as well as agents for experiments predicting vulnerability events on GitHub.

<<<<<<<<<< github_experiment.py >>>>>>>>>>
The experiment creates initial state of the simulation, runs the simulation and evaluates simulation results.
Here is an example hot to run it
python github_experiment.py ~/data/json_data/vuln_exp_1m_sql all 1 GithubAll3Agent Dash2.github_vulnerability.github_agent 20170801 20170831 ~/data/json_data/vuln_exp_1m_sql_simulation ~/data/events/ 20170701  20170731  20170701 20170731 "SQL injection,sql injection"

Explanation:
~/data/json_data/vuln_exp_1m_sql - path and name of the initial state files (prefix of initial state files)
all 1 - don't change this part, don't need it for this experiment
GithubAll3Agent - agent class name
Dash2.github_vulnerability.github_agent - agent module name
20170801 20170831 - time interval for the simulation
~/data/json_data/vuln_exp_1m_sql_simulation - path and name for simulation output files (prefix for simulation output files)
20170701  20170731 - time interval for simulation training, based on this interval initial state (agents and repos) are created
20170701 20170731 "SQL injection,sql injection" - time interval and comma-separated keywords for vulnerability event identification. Based on that interval probabilities to identify vulnerability (good buys) and introduce events (bad guys) are computed


<<<<<<<<<< github_agent.py >>>>>>>>>>
This module contains three agents: base, reporter, all3
